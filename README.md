# <p align="center">TheCamp Intern-Jam</p>

# Context
This is the landing page I made for **TheCamp** in *less than 48hrs* to get my internship in 2022.
<br/>

**TheCamp** is an innovation center that delivers technology-driven seminars to companies all over the south region in **France**.

> The page retrieves an offical API and displays according info into the side widgets.
<br/>

**Disclaimer :**
The actual website might be really different from the preview, as the company is regurlarly changing the API
